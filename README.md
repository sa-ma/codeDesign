# Code and Design

This is a community of Developers and Designers.

Code and Design is an initiative that specializes on building young developers to help identify social and technological needs in the society.

We are tasked with helping each other with coding problems, and to ensure all members are aware of the latest opportunities in the software development ecosystem amongst other activities and projects.
